# Setting Up PETSc Development in VS Code

This document outlines the steps I followed to set up my PETSc development environment for C programming in Visual Studio Code.

## 1. Download, Configure, and Build PETSc

- **Download PETSc:**  
  Follow the instructions on the [PETSc website](https://petsc.org/release/install/) to download PETSc.

- **Configure PETSc:**  
  Run the configuration script. Note that sometimes you need to reconfigure PETSc (using `./reconfigure`) to add or remove packages after the initial configuration.  
  Example:
  ```bash
  ./configure --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=gfortran --download-mpich --download-fblaslapack
  ```
  You may later run `./reconfigure` if you need to adjust package settings.

- **Build PETSc:**  
  After configuration, compile PETSc:
  ```bash
  make all check
  ```

## 2. Set Environment Variables

Add the PETSc environment variables to your shell configuration (e.g., `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
export PETSC_DIR=/home/stefano/petsc
export PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux-c-debug
```

After editing, source your `.bashrc`:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```


## 3. Download C/C++ Extensions for VSCode
There are several VSCode extensions that make it possible to develop C/C++ in VSCode. I use the suite developed my Microsoft: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)


## 4. Set Up VS Code Build Task

Create a folder called `.vscode` in your project directory (if it doesn't already exist). Then create a `tasks.json` file in that folder.

For a new project, you can use **Ctrl+Shift+B** to run the default build task once this file is set up. The following example is configured to build the currently active C file.

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Build Current C File",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "mpicc",
      "args": [
        "${file}",
        "-g",
        "-O0",
        "-I${env:PETSC_DIR}/include",
        "-I${env:PETSC_DIR}/${env:PETSC_ARCH}/include",
        "-L${env:PETSC_DIR}/${env:PETSC_ARCH}/lib",
        "-lpetsc",
        "-o",
        "${workspaceFolder}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}"
      ],
      "options": {
        "env": {
          "PETSC_DIR": "/home/stefano/petsc",
          "PETSC_ARCH": "arch-linux-c-debug"
        }
      },
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "problemMatcher": ["$gcc"]
    }
  ]
}

```

### Notes:
- **Command:**  
  The build command uses `mpicc` (the MPI C compiler wrapper), which is typical for compiling PETSc programs.
- **Include & Library Paths:**  
  The task uses the environment variables `PETSC_DIR` and `PETSC_ARCH` to set up the correct include paths (`-I`) and library paths (`-L`).
- **Environment Variables in Tasks:**  
  The `"options": { "env": { ... } }` block ensures that even if VS Code does not inherit your shellâ€™s environment, the task still gets the correct variables.
- **Debugging**
    The `-g` flag generates debug symbols and `-O0` disables optimizations that can sometimes cause the debugger to skip or inline code in unexpected ways.

## 5. Running the Code

- **Compile:**  
  Use **Ctrl+Shift+B** in VS Code to build the project. The build task will compile the current active file `example.c` into `example`

- **Running the Executable:**  
  After compilation, open a terminal (or use the integrated terminal) and run:
  ```bash
  ./example
  ```
  If you encounter an error about shared libraries (e.g., `libpetsc.so.3.22` not found), ensure your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` includes the PETSc library directory:
  ```bash
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PETSC_DIR/arch-linux-c-debug/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  ./main
  ```

## 6. Using the Debugger 

Inside of `.vscode` we need to setup a `.launch.json` file to run the debugger. The following is an example of a `.launch.json` file with two configuration one
for serial debugging and another for parallel debugging (which doesn't technically work and the PETSc docs suggest using Totalview for parallel debugging anyway: [https://petsc.org/release/miscellaneous/codemanagement/](https://petsc.org/release/miscellaneous/codemanagement/)). They are setup to run on the active C file.
